"""Attendance business logic.

The old code marked attendance in four places (manual form, detected-face POST,
auto-mark loop, quick status toggle) and each one did the same read-then-write:

    existing = AttendanceRecord.query.filter_by(student_id=..., date=today).first()
    if existing: return "already marked"
    db.session.add(AttendanceRecord(...)); db.session.commit()

Two concurrent requests both see no row and both insert.  There was no unique
constraint to stop them, so the table accumulated duplicates that then skewed every
analytics percentage.  :func:`mark_attendance` is the single write path now, and it
relies on the database constraint instead of a prior read.
